mypy tool:
mypy is an open-source static type checker for Python.
It supports type annotations for function arguments, return values, and variables.
It can also check for common type-related errors such as type mismatches, invalid method calls, and incorrect argument types.
mypy supports various types of annotations including built-in types like str, int, float, etc., user-defined classes, generic types, and union types.
It also provides options to customize the checking process, ignore certain files, and suppress specific error messages
